Computer language :- 

>Machine level language 
a) Computer can understand only digital signal , Which is binary digit Eg 0 and 1
b) So the instuction given to the computer can be only inbinary code 

example : 
    Decimal Number       |         4-bit Binary Number
          9              |             1001
          10             |             1010

     Alphabets           |         binary number 
         A               |           01000001
         B               |           01000010
 Deep knownlogy : - 
Machine code are present in binary lanaguage. As    

>Assembly Language 
a) The difficulties faced in machine level language were reduced to some extent by using a modified form of machine level language called assembly language 
> In assembly language instrction are given in english like word as MOV,ADD SUBB etc 
>Assembly language is also know as low level language .
>Assembly level language need a translator  "Assembler". Where we are using english word as it necessary to convert the program to binary language 

Assembly language  ====>  Assembler  ======> binary language (machine code)
