Bits: There many question around us How PC work using binary number. 
So, Staring from Start ,

What are binary number and bits?
=>A binary number is a numerical value represented in the base-2 numeral system,
  which uses only two symbols: "0" and "1." This system is a method of expressing
  numbers using just these two digits. Binary numbers can represent natural numbers
  as well as rational numbers that have a finite expression in base-2. Specifically,
   a rational binary number is the result of dividing an integer by a power of two.
   This compact and straightforward system forms the foundation of modern computing 
    and digital logic.

  2) Bits (short for binary digits) are the smallest unit of data in computing and 
     digital communications. A bit can have one of two possible values: 0 or 1, which
    correspond to the binary numeral system. These two states often represent concepts
     such as off/on, false/true, or low/high in electrical systems.
